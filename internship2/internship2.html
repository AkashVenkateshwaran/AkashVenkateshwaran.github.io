									<h2 class="major">DESCRIPTION</h2>
									<p>Tremendous advancements in computing have accelerated the progress in cancer research in various ways. Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have paved way for remarkable improvements in biomedical image analysis. Deep learning algorithms are being extensively applied to biological images and these are transforming the analysis and interpretation of imaging data. Image processing and machine learning techniques have powered various aspects of computerized microscopy image analysis for medical investigation and clinical practice. This work aims to use image processing and deep learning techniques to study cell morphological properties and motility behaviour from time-lapse microscopy images of cell cultures in a variety of conditions. The data used for this work was obtained by 24 hours time-lapse imaging of Multicellular Tumor Spheroid (MCTS) in culture medium. Firstly, cell segmentation process is carried out on the data. As the first step, cell localization is performed on the images to detection of approximate locations and number of cells in the clusters. The next stage is cell boundary detections in which the cell boundary was determined using both the Threshold-based segmentation scheme and Edge-based segmentation scheme. After cell segmentation, the segmented cell images are used as input for multi-class cell classification using Convolutional Neural Network. In this work, a simple CNN is used for classifying the cells into four classes based on their substrate stiffness and chemical coating.<br><br>
