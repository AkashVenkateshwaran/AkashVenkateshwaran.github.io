									<h2 class="major">DESCRIPTION</h2>
									<p>This article examines the impact of boundary conditions on the buckling load for rectangular uniform isotropic plates of different aspect ratio and cut-out shape. Tests have been completed on Aluminum alloy plates with circular holes and notches under different boundary conditions comprising of clamped, fixed and their combinations are considered. Analysis by analytical method is led and the effect of aspect ratio, boundary conditions and cut-out shape on the buckling behavior of isotropic plates under in-plane axial compression load is investigated and discussed. Buckling analysis is performed by employing finite elemental analysis software ANSYS. The numerical results received are in true agreement with the formerly posted data.<br><br>

										 In this investigation, the commercial finite element code ANSYS was used as a tool for performing numerical analysis. The investigation included five different type of rectangular plates, four different lengths, two variation in thickness which contributed to a total of eight L/T ratio, four different radius of cut-outs and finally 2 set of boundary conditions.A total of 1024 configurations.
