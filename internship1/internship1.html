									<h2 class="major">DESCRIPTION</h2>
									<p>Turbulence modeling of 3D surge waves for different Froude numbers was conducted using Large Eddy Simulation. Open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM was used to study the turbulence structures and air entrainment in the positive surge front. The interFoam solver is utilized based on the Volume of Fluid method to capture the nature of two-phase flow. Smagorinsky-Lilly model was employed to model the sub-grid-scale eddies.<br><br>

									Surge waves move downstream at a constant celerity. Thus for post-processing, an imaginary window frame of reference was made that moves along with the same celerity to capture the wave. This method helped to observe a transient moving body into a stationary wave similar to a hydraulic jump.<br><br>

									Once the wave was made stationary, the water surface profile, air entrainment ratio, alpha air percentile, moments (skewness and kurtosis) of perturbation, resolved and modeled turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress tensor, turbulence anisotropy tensor, Lumley triangle invariants and characteristic spheroids of turbulence were calculated. <br><br>

A weighted algorithm was used to capture the moving frame of reference. Edge detection method was used to extract the surface profile of water excluding the splash effect. Eigendecomposition algorithm was used in Reynolds and anisotropy tensor for the Lumley triangle and spheroids.<br><br>
