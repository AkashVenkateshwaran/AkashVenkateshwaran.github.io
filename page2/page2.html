									<h2 class="major">DESCRIPTION</h2>
									<p>In a hypothetical severe accident that happens in a light water reactor (LWR), the melt pool could be formed in the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). Remaining these molten materials inside RPV and preventing further leakage of these melt materials from RPV are treated as one of the severe accident management methods. In this aspect, one of the key issues is that the heat transfer from the melt pool to the RPV wall should be less than the corresponding critical heat flux (CHF) outside the vessel. The natural convection behavior in melt pools plays an important role in determining the heat flux from the melt pool to the RPV wall. Up to now, various experiments have been conducted to study the internally heated natural convection behavior in melt pools. Their experimental data are used for numerical simulation for better understanding.<br><br>


 									One of these experiments is the COPRA (COrium Pool Research Apparatus) experiment, of which the test section was the full scale and nitrate salt of which the physical properties are close to the prototypical material was used as the simulant material, improved the theoretical knowledge of the transient and steady-state phases of melt pool natural convection behavior. However, there are still uncertain and unclear phenomena related to the natural convection behavior in internally heated melt pools<br><br>

									In this study how geometric size could affect the internal heated melt pool natural convection behavior is investigated. The numerical study is carried out using a commercial software, ANSYS FLUENT 20.2. Since the experiment is too expensive and time-consuming, it is not feasible to perform a physical experiment for different vessel geometries. A large-scale COPRA facility that was used for experimental research is modeled numerically with eutectic salt, i.e. the binary mixture of 50 mol% NaNO3 â€“ 50 mol% KNO3 was selected as the simulant material for corium. The temperature contours and liquid fraction of the crust formed along the wall is studied for various geometric cases.Additionally, the Nusselt number and Rayleigh number for each geometry is calculated and a co-relation is obtained.</p>
