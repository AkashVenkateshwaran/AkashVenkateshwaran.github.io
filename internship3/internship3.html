									<h2 class="major">DESCRIPTION</h2>
									<p>This project presents a data-driven model proposed for the prediction of the velocity ﬁeld around a cylinder using deep neural networks using measurements of the pressure ﬁeld on the cylinder. ANSYS Fluent simulations for ﬂow around a cylinder at various Reynolds numbers (2,10,60,65,70,75,100,200) are carried out to establish a dataset capturing the impact of the Reynolds number on ﬂow properties. The network layers can process the pressure information by features extraction to obtain the velocity distribution. <br><br>The DNN is trained using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data set to establish the mapping relationship between the pressure ﬂuctuations on the cylinder and the velocity ﬁeld around the cylinder. This architecture can capture features of pressure ﬂuctuations on the cylinder and use them to acquire the velocity field. The pressure distribution over the surface of the cylinder was plotted against theta. It was found that the CFD plot and the Model plot had a very similar trend.  By comparing the output data of the typical network with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results as reference values, it is proven that this deep neural network can successfully predict the velocity in the vicinity of the trained Reynolds numbers with various inlet flow profiles and achieves a high overall precision. The active prospects of neural networks in fluid mechanics have also been demonstrated, which can inspire more kinds of prediction models in the future.<br><br>
