									<p>Gas stove is one of the most common and basic domestic appliances found in any home in the subcontinent. It is the foremost article used for cooking at home, and thus necessitates interaction with it by the users in a significant way. Despite the advent of more advanced devices like the microwave oven or the induction cooktop, a traditional gas stove reigns supreme in the lives of homemakers. Therefore, an endeavor was undertaken to design a product that would enhance the performance of a gas stove, and ease the usage of it, by way of alleviating the general problems faced by users in its operation. Design thinking strategies had been followed throughout the stages of the product development, beginning with the empathy, to understand the desirable needs, translating them into tangible target specifications for the product to achieve, and used the ideation techniques to develop the concepts into feasible product.<br><br> The morphological method of concept generation yielded possible concepts aimed towards a solution, which were evaluated by following the analysis techniques of Forced Decision (FD) and Decision Alternative Ratio Evaluation (DARE). The filtered concept was then subjected to product architecture design, where it was given an efficient physical form, and finally the parametric design result was evaluated by means of various Design For Excellence (DFX) guidelines, in order to ensure that the product was the most compact, efficient and reliable version of itself. This paper comprises of expositions of all the aforementioned processes as carried out, along with the final result, and pertinent analyses.<br><br>

									This research paper is an extension to the Project component in a course titled "New Product Development"
